# Paper 1 Notes

## Chosen Text
- "United" Cathy Park Hong

## Themes of My Writing  
- What it means to be white
    - Could tie in opening speech from Atlanta S3
    - The fear associated with being socialized into a 
society that in many ways makes no sense
- Model Minority/Immigration
    - May help rhetoric to quote politicians on immigration
and status of immigrant or non-white workers in society.
    - General alienation, should probably reread Beauvoir  
        - Social group of the other

## Quote Collection
- Pg. 27 "Asians are next in line to be white" 
    - "Asians are next in line to disappear"
    - "Amnesiac fog"

End your paper by providing your own opinion on the work and your authorâ€™s argument.

believable
