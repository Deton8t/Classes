   *Minor Feelings* by Cathy Park Hong discusses what it means to be Asian American. In the first chapter "United" Hong describes the Asian American identity through her own. Through this Hong shows what it means to be an "Other" in this country specifically a Korean "Other". There is an inherent wrongness to how Americans are socialized around race. This wrongness manifests in roadblocks in Hong's life, such as in her pursuit of a poetry Masters. In both direct and indirect ways Hong paints the lasting anxiety related to not being white.
