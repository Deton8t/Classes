https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi6UOey-YAw

- Going over kinda what happened and talking with a lot of vets,
- Some discussion with the british soldier of the horror of the prison camps
- Moreno talks well about his experience and how horrible it was 
- Lot of reference to military technology, trench warfare, US air advantage
- Poor reception coming home, despite all their suffering they did not gain prestige when coming home
