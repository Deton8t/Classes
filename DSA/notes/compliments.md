# Binary Compliments

## 1's
- Flip every bit

10010011(147 if u -73 if int) -> 1's compliment -> 01101100(108 if u 54 if int)

Gives you what you would need to get max value

## 2's
- 1's + adding 1

0001(1) -> 2's compliment -> 1110 + 1 = 1111
Showing it works:  
   1111 (-1)
+  0001 (+1)
=1|0000 ( 0) 

   0100 (+4)
+  1111 (-1)
=1|0011 (+3) 

overflow bit is lost into the aether
neat!
